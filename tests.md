## Automated Testing

### Validating Code

Validation services were used to ensure that code was valid code used to develop the website.

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test HTML code to ensure it was valid code
I needed to remove jinja to ensure this first.
- [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to test CSS code to ensure it was valid code.
- [Code Beautify JavaScript Validator](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate) was used to test JavaScript code to ensure it was valid code.
