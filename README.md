[Recipe Nest](https://listing-of-recipes.herokuapp.com) is a website created to give users access & full control over recipes.
It's a platform that has been designed to allow the user to be able to easily browse for different recipes,
allowing users to create their own recipes, make any amendments to recipes & gives the user the option
to be able to delete their recipes. In addition to friendly colours, designs & animations, it makes a great
recipe platform!

## UX

### Project Purpose

The goal of Recipe Nest is to give users full access & control over all recipes. This
means they are able to create recipes, view all recipes, update any recipe & delete any recipe.

### User Experience

- Users get a great sense of usability from the get-go. They are presented with a burger icon at the top of
the screen for mobile & tablet display & a navigation bar on desktop display for Home, List of recipes &
Create recipe. A logo has been included in the top right on mobile and tablet & top left on desktop to help
easily navigate back to the homepage at any given time.

- An introductory heading has been included to welcome the user to the website.

- A search bar has been included on all displays so they can search for a recipe they would like to find
right away along with a down chevron (arrow), which has been placed as an indicator to the user that
there is more information below should the user be confused. The arrow is also clickable & will smoothly scroll
down the page when it's clicked.

- All cards on the website have a clickable image, title & 'view recipe' button which will navigate the
user to that particular recipe page. Should they want a quick look at the description of the recipe,
ellipses (3 horizontal dots) have been put on each card as an indicator to view the description before
they click to view the whole recipe.

- Bread crumbs have been included at the top of specific pages to help easily navigate back to pages
they have previously come from.

- When a user has mistakenly inputted a wrong path in the URL, a 404 page will show with a link back to the
home page.

- Asterisks (Star symbols) have been included in each form fields to indicate which fields are required to be
filled in before submission. If a user has submitted a form without filling in a required field, validation
has been included & will prompt the user to input any particular input field that is required. Also, placeholders have been
given to instruct the users on how the information they give should be sectioned out.

- Edit recipe fields are filled out automatically so that the user does not need to input all of the previous values back in
before they submit an update.

- When the delete button is clicked on the recipe page, the user is presented with a modal to ensure they want to
delete their recipe permanently.

- The player does not need to click a back button or to reload the page. Easy and informative buttons have been provided
at all times to ensure the user has an easy way around the website.
