[**Further Testing**](#further-testing)\n<br>\n\n## Automated Testing\n\n### Validating Code\n\nValidation services were used to ensure that code was valid code used to develop the website.\n\n- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test HTML code to ensure it was valid code.\nI needed to remove jinja to ensure this first.\n- [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to test CSS code to ensure it was valid code.\n- [Code Beautify JavaScript Validator](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate) was used to test JavaScript code to ensure it was valid code.\n\n\n### Python Testing\n\nPython testing was included in my project to test the business logic of recipe views and models.\n\nAs this was the first time I was doing Python testing, I decided to do my testing after writing my code.\nAs it wasn't possible to tests every single function in my app.py, I tested around 70% of my function.\n\nAn input called 'unittest' was used to carry out the testing.\n\nThe functions that were tested were as follows:\n\n - Home Page\n - Recipe Listing\n - Recipe\n - Search Recipe\n - Create Recipe\n - Delete Recipe\n - 404 Error\n\nWhen all of the testing was complete, I got \"All tests passed\" printing in the terminal.\n\n## User Stories Testing\n\nThis follows on from each of the **'User Stories'** items from the **'UX'** section in [README.md](README.md).\n\n- ### As a user, I'd like to see:\n    - ### A professional and strong looking website to draw the user into using the website.\n        - A colour scheme of black, white & blue were used to help with a friendly looking design.\n        - The Materialize library was used in order to give it a strong & professional look.\n        - Everything was sectioned out nicely & carefully thought off to give the best presentation to the user.\n        - A dark image was used as the main image to contrast nicely with the rest of the website.\n        - Button colours were carefully selected to ensure they were coloured corrected to their primary prupose.\n    - ### Navigations which are simple & informative which don't leave the user unsure of how to get to the page they want to get to.\n        - You will find a navigation on every page of website.\n        - The Recipe Logo will navigate you back to the home page.\n        - Breadcrumbs have been added to all pages which are necessary to jump back to specific pages with\n        the name of the page that is linked this helps alot with the website navigation.\n        - If you hit the 404 error page at any point. There is a button which allows you to go back to the home page.\n    - ### Buttons which are simple but informative & give a good indication of their purpose.\n        - Button have been labelled correctly with their accordance.\n        - They have been given the appropriate colour for either purpose.\n    - ### Subtle animations to not overcomplicate the website, but to give a strong professional look & feel.\n        - Buttons & images throughout the website have a nice waves effect when clicked.\n        - Input fields are been given a nice animation when the field is active. The placeholder will jump to the top\n        & the underline & placeholder will trasnform to blue.\n        - A back to top chevron has a nice animation when you hover over it, it will transform to blue from white &\n        rotate.\n        - A downwards chevron has been animated to give an indication that there is more information below.\n    - ### Good separation between each instruction.\n        - When inputting the information for each instruction, It instructs you to input each piece of instructions,\n        seperated by a full stop. When it reaches the front-end. It will list each item in a 'step' for each\n        instruction.\n    - ### I have full control over all recipes on the website.\n        - You are able to view all of the recipes on the website.\n        - You can search for any recipe on the website.\n        - Any user can edit any of the recipes.\n        - Any user can create a recipe.\n        - Any user can delete any of the recipes.\n\n## Manual Testing\n\nA number of manual tests were done to ensure the website was working with it's intended purpose and use.\n\n### Testing on Desktop\n\nThe website was tested numerous times in Browsers: Chrome, Safari, FireFox and Internet Explorer\non a Laptop, Macbook & Desktop PC.\n\n#### 1. Dashboard\n\nI checked that:\n\n- The main image is loading properly, is 100 view height & there are no issues with the height or width.\n- There is an animation on the search bar when the page is loaded for the first time, it should blur into vision.\n- The animation for the downwards chevron is working & that it's clickable.\n- There is no upwards chevron in the bottom right-hand corner until the page has been scrolled down.\n- My Github repo in the footer links correctly to my github repo for the project & that it opens up in a new tab.\n- The Favicon is loading correctly.\n- The upwards chevron is appearing when scrolled down the page & that it's animating correctly when hovered over\n& when it's clicked.\n- The navbar is correctly animating so the main logo is decreasing in size & that is has a darkened background\nwhen scrolled down.\n- The footer was properly sitting at the bottom of the page as I added a sticky footer to the bottom.\n\n#### 2.

This would allow the image to\n    shrink to fit inside of the card. This would prevent stretching out the card & stretching the image.\n\n    ``` css\n    max-height: 264px;\n    max-height: 264px;\n    margin: auto;\n    }\n    ```\n\n1. #### Issues with image sizes on the recipe cards.\n\n    There was an issue with the images in the cards when they were different dimensions, their default behavior\n    is to stretch & shrink the card which can leave the cards looking messy if all of the images were scaled differently.\n    \n    **How it was fixed**:\n\n    - I set a max height & a max width to the card images & set the margin to auto.

I tried searching the internet but\n    I couldn't find the answer.\n    \n2. #### Glitchy upwards chevron.\n\n    At times, the upwards chevron can become glitchy & will animate on click instead of hover.\n    \n    I did try to look for the answer to this but I didn't see this as a major issue as the\n    chevron was still working as it should.\n    \n## Further Testing\n\n- Friends, family and fellow students were asked to check the website on all devices they had, they tested functionality and layout,\npositive and constructive criticism was provided.\n- Tested in Chrome DevTools on all different devices and by scrolling up and down in the responsive setting.\n","undoManager":{"mark":77,"position":100,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":49,"column":0},"end":{"row":49,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["
